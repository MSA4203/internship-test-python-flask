# Internship Test - Python + Flask
A test for those applying an internship at HasGeek

This is an Python based evaluation to test your ability to pick up the Flask framework and finish a simple website that shows you a score and allows a user to increment or decrement that score. It uses the basics of Flask, Logical Templating, form submission and GET/POST requests.

The framework is already written for you, you just need to fill in the bits where there are comments.

## You will need to do the following

 - Write a route for `/count` which will accept the form submission and increment/decrement the score value
 - You will need write a simple template to display the score value and style it based on whether it's greater or less than 0.
 - Include a requirements.txt file with whatever dependencies you need.


## Please submit a Pull Request to this repository with a working version.

## Keep in mind

Try and keep your commits messages clean, and leave comments explaining what you are doing wherever it makes sense. Also try and use meaningful variable/function names, and maintain indentation and code style.
